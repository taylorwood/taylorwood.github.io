My programming journey began in elementary school with [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) writing text adventures. Ever since I've had a moderate-to-severe case of programming obsession.

In the late 1990s I started dabbling in PHP and C++ for dynamic web apps and Windows desktop software.

In the early 2000s I started writing C# and started [writing about programming and publishing code](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2286/Window-Hiding-with-C).

Around 2012 I got a copy of [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer) and decided I must learn functional programming -- it truly altered my career. Since then I've had the good fortune to work with F#, Clojure, Scala and other fun languages.

My professional software work has involved areas such as print, journalism, data mining and classification, finance, online grocery, e-commerce, machine learning, and most recently healthcare.

I live in Chicago, IL and like to [play music](http://www.daytrotter.com/seafarer/daytrotter-studio-january-18-2011.html) (guitar, piano, drums), listen to music, kiss my baby, eat delicious food, and contribute to open-source software whenever possible.
