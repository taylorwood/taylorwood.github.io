My programming journey began in sixth grade with [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic), writing text adventures and guitar tuners.

In the late 1990s I started dabbling in PHP and C++, creating what was surely the first content management system ever _(in my home town)_.

In the early 2000s I started writing C# and peaked early with [my most popular publication to date](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2286/Window-Hiding-with-C).

Circa 2012 I got a copy of [The Little Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer) and decided I must become a functional programmer. Since then I've been writing F# and Clojure and loving every minute of it!

My professional work has involved areas such as print, journalism, data mining and classification, finance, online grocery, and e-commerce.

I live in Chicago, IL and like to [play music](http://www.daytrotter.com/seafarer/daytrotter-studio-january-18-2011.html) (guitar, piano, drums, vuvuzela), listen to music, see live music, take pictures, eat delicious food, drink delicious midwestern beer, and contribute to open-source software whenever possible.
